# Meteor-Detection

 The project leveraged BIRA-IASB’s BRAMS network, a unique collection of
radio receiving stations designed for forward scatter radio observations of me-
teoroids.Calders & Lamy (2012) The goal was to develop analytical model for
interpreting BRAMS data and to create models for simulating the hypersonic
entry of meteoroids and Understanding the speed and size of incoming mete-
ors is essential for assessing their potential impact on Earth and for developing
effective monitoring systems. Accurate classification and analysis can help pre-
dict the energy released upon atmospheric entry and its potential effects on the
Earth’s surface or atmosphere.
The objectives of this research is to:
• Develop analytical model to process and identify meteor data from the
BRAMS radio spectrum data.
• Develop a model that achieves high accuracy, precision, and F1 score, and
is capable of accurately predicting meteors on unseen data.
